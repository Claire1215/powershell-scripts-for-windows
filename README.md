# powershell-scripts-for-windows

These PowerShell scripts automate the tasks for deploying a web application in IIS and managing a Windows service. The scripts handle:
1. **IIS configuration** for a web application with HTTPS binding, app pools, and logging.
2. **Windows service creation** and configuration with auto-start and error recovery.

You can modify the script parameters (like `userName`, `appPoolName`, `certThumbprint`, etc.) based on your specific requirements. These scripts can also be run on deployment servers to automate the entire process.
